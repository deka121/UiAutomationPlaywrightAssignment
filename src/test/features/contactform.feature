Feature: Contact Form Functionality
        As a user of the "Shady Meadows Hotel" website,
        I want to submit the contact form
        so that I can inquire about the room.
        I also want to receive appropriate error messages
        so that I know when I have not filled out the form correctly.


  Background: navigation to contact page
        Given the user navigates to the Contact page

  Scenario Outline: Submitting a contact form with valid details
    When the user fills in the Name field with "<Name>"
    And the user fills in the Email field with "<Email>"
    And the user fills in the Phone field with "<Phone>"
    And the user fills in the Subject field with "<Subject>"
    And the user fills in the Message field with "<Message>"
    And the user clicks the Submit button
    Then the user should see a confirmation message "Thanks for getting in touch <Name>!"
